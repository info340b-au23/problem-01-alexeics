    <p>Miles Morales is a character from Marvel Comics and the main protagonist of the Spider-Verse film trilogy. 
        He is one variation of the character "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man">Spider-Man,</a>" boasting the iconic abilities and strength that
        we all know and love. Here are some reasons why I like him:

    <ul>
        <li>He's a funny guy</li>
        <li class="music">He listens to good music</li>
        <li>He has cool friends</li>
    </ul>
